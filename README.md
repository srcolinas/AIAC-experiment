# AIAC-experiment

I want to dive deeper into different ways to use AI assisted coding in my workflow as a profesional engineer. So I decided to create an application following different approaches and have my (biased) opinion on how well the coding tool helped me. Note that my thoughts will be limited to an application that was built from scratch, which is not the only type of work we developers do.

## The Application

The application is an online game inspired by Settlers of Catan, but it senters around the Tayrona people, its economy and ways of building. 

## Results

| Experiment              | Summary | Deep Dive | Repository |
| :---------------- | :------: | ----: | ----: |
| Give the agent just a rough description of the intent |   Agent created a readme with reasonable adaptations from the original game, but I followed the instructions it created and didn't work.    | ... | https://github.com/srcolinas/AIAC-V0 |

## Notes

* Since I review each experiment, some ideas from the output of an experiment may leak into an execution of the next. I will try to be fair in the deep dive section.
* Experiments are done in different repositories to avoid leaking information from one commit to the next in the agent. 
* The code review made in the deep dive is clearly subjective, as a lot of it may be defined by my own approach to write the type of application involved.
* I don't know the extend of agent's access to my different folder history and even browser history, but it may leak information into the experiments.
